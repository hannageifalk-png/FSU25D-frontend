	<h2>What is Semantic HTML</h2>
	<p>
		Semantic HTML is to implement elements with consideration to the meaning of the element, and not just how its displayed.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The benefits of Semantic HTML
		<ol>
			<li>Increase accessibility for users</li>
			<li>Increase accessibility for assistive technologies</li>
			<li>Increase search engine ranking (SEO)</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<header>
		<h1>header </h1>
		<p>
		The HTML < header> element represents a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also other elements like a logo, wrapped section's header, a search form, and so on.
		</p>
	</header>

	<nav>
		<h1>nav</h1>
		<p>The HTML < nav> element (HTML Navigation Element) represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with navigation links.</p>
	</nav> 

	<div class="cf">
		<main>
			<h1>main</h1>
			<p>The HTML < main> element represents the main content of  the < body> of a document or application. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to, or expands upon the central topic of a document or the central functionality of an application. This content should be unique to the document, excluding any content that is repeated across a set of documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms (unless the document's main function is as a search form).</p>
			<section >
				<h1>section</h1>
				<p>The HTML < section > element represents a standalone section — which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it — contained within an HTML document.
				</p>
			</section> 

			<article>
				<h1>article</h1>
				<p>
				The HTML < article> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, an object, or any other independent item of content. Each < article> should be identified, typically by including a heading (< h1>-< h6> element) as a child of the < article> element.
				</p>
			</article>
		</main>

		<aside>
			<h1>aside</h1>
			<p>The HTML < aside> element represents a section of the page with content connected tangentially to the rest, which could be considered separate from that content. These sections are often represented as sidebars or inserts. They often contain the definitions on the sidebars, such as definitions from the glossary; there may also be other types of information, such as related advertisements; the biography of the author; web applications; profile information or related links on the blog.</p>
		</aside>
	</div>

	<footer>
		<section>
			<h2>address</h2>
			<p>The HTML < address > element indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization. Example: </p>
			<address>
				You can contact author at <a href="http://www.somedomain.com/contact">www.somedomain.com</a>.<br>
				If you see any bugs, please <a href="mailto:webmaster@somedomain.com">contact webmaster</a>.<br>

			</address>
		</section>
		<h1>footer</h1>
		<p> The HTML < footer> element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.
